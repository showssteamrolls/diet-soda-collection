        <p>Hi, my name is Anthony Tian. I enjoy diet soda and saving the bottles after finishing them. <br>
            Each 2-liter cylinder is another Lego that I add to my pyramid, sitting next to my desk. <br>
            Last semester I had a collection of roughly 37 bottles, but they were recycled over winter break— unbelievable! <br>
            But it's okay, we're back with a vengeance. The semester is not half over, and we're at 40+ already. <br>
            Earlier today, I restocked five more: Diet Coke, Diet Coke Caffeine Free, and Sprite Zero. <br>
            Here’s a picture of the current progress.</p>

        <p>
            One of my favorite things about this collection is the wide variety of colors I've collected.<br>
          It's almost as exciting as catching pokemon.<br><br>  
            When piecing together the pyramid like legoes, I made sure to line the side with some of my favorite soda bottles.<br>
          I like the red of Coke Zero, and the bronze yellowish color of Caffeine-Free Diet Coke.<br>
          In the middle, I have a line of green going right up diagonally–– that was enjoyable to put together.<br>
          I took my Diet Mtn Dews, 7-Up Zero's, and Ginger Ales, and stacked them to make that appearance. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, I've tasted plenty of different flavors and have found my favorites. My go-tos are definitely Diet Mtn Dew, <br>
          Sunkist Zero, and Caffeine-Free Diet Coke. Something about these three, the sweetness is a lot stronger and stays even after <br>
          initial opening for days. Mountain Dew and Sunkist keep their fruit flavor very well too–– I love 'em. Another good one is <br>
          Diet Pepsi, which may be surprising. Something about Diet Pepsi, its carbonation seems extra strong. And that's sometimes <br>
          enjoyable for me.
